# text-generator

This is a Python implementation of a LSTM recurrent neural network to generate text character by character based off a given text corpus, using Keras. This project is still in beta at the time of writing.

Initially the set-up scrapes song lyrics for a given rap artist from http://www.ohhla.com/, as all songs are saved as .txt files. However, the functionality is being built so any arbritrary text file can serve as an input, and I may write a module to generate text data from Dark Souls/Bloodborne lore at some point.
